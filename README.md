- 👋 Hi, I’m @vo-dx. I would love to share with you all some projects that I've had for a long time in my head.
- 👀 I’m interested in mechatronics, robotics, and of course, programming. I love 3D modelling as well and I'm also interested in social topics.
- 🌱 I’m currently re-learning technologies that I've worked with before, trying to refresh my knowledge.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on designing new technology, preferably robotics. Something useful and benefical to our society.
- 📫 How to reach me: my LinkedIn profile, www.linkedin.com/in/vo-dx
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her 
- ⚡ Fun fact: I dream of being invited to be part of a Master Cheff season.
